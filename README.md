# Guide to Interactive Brokers API Code

## Overview 

These programs can help you make the first steps towards working with the Interactive Brokers API. Interactive Brokers API can be very challenging when first getting started and the formal Interactive Brokers documentation lacks some detailed explanation and implementations. 

**The code is based off a guide from** [**The Quant Academy**](https://thequantacademy.com/ "The Quant Academy Website")

If you'd like to learn quickly and receive the most detailed and accurate information, it's worth checking out.

It is incredibly helpful to read the articles to gain an understanding of the fundamentals and rationale behind the code. 

## Run

The code should be placed in the folder with the API files (at the top level) then can be run with the command: 

> python3 ibProgram1.py

The TWS must be open and configured to accept incoming connection on the specified port.

## Support

*More articles and code will come with time, so give a follow on Github or Medium to receive the most up to date content :)*
